Due to the property being purchased decades ago, the garden land was held under a different title number to the actual house itself. Upon discovering this, the Defendant, who is also one of the residuary beneficiaries, interprets the will in  a way that the gift to the Claimant was of the ‘house’ on its own and not the garden. This meant that the house would pass to Claimant, but the garden would form part of the residue of the estate, ultimately benefiting the Defendant. The Claimant interpretation of the will is that the garden passed to him as part of the gift of the house. The house, he said, included the garden. He argued that his aunt had not specifically mentioned the garden in the will as she considered it to be part of her house and it would not have occurred to her that anyone would seek to separate the two. The Claimant seeks a judgment on the issue of the gardens to resolve this matter and allow the estate to be administered",Will and probate

The Claimants discovered that although the deceased had left a Will, this did not mention the Claimants and the Solicitors who held the Will wouldn’t provide details of the Will because they didn’t benefit from the Will. The father had previously made a gift of a car to one of the Claimants and indicated that they would all benefit from his Will.

"The Claimant sought to judicially review the decision of Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, to abolish Regional Strategies (“RSSs”) which had been announced in a Parliamentary Statement on 6 July 2010. The challenge was brought because Claimant fears the abolition would materially affect its case on an appeal against the refusal of planning permission for a proposed residential development.  The Claimant disputes whether:a).the Secretary of State had the power to abolish RSSs; b).that decision was in breach of the Secretary of State’s obligations under the Environment Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004.Determination 6.The power of the Secretary of State -under s. 79(6) of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 -did not extend to effecting the practical abrogation of RSSs as a complete tier of planning policy guidance by executive action.

Following the July 2010 announcement that the Claimant’s advisors wrote to the Council urging that the intended abolition was highly relevant and that the Committee should reconsider whether in principle permission should be granted. That reconsideration did not take place and permission was granted.The Claimant seeks for a court to take an objective view of materiality it was required to have regard to all the facts and circumstances viewed broadly. Theoretical relevance to a planning decision could be excluded as insufficiently material adopting a de minimis approach. That was not to confuse materiality and weight, but to recognise the true scope of materiality. Further, as the Claimant had been obliged to accept, materiality has regard to practical effect. A planning authority is not obliged to take account of considerations which objectively viewed would have no practical effect upon the decision as to land use to which it has to come",Planning

"The Claimant seeks from the court judgment that his father John Williams lacked knowledge and approval of his 2014 Will despite being drafted by solicitors who properly executed his instructions. The Claimant states that prior to his death of John Williams the deceased visited his solicitors office in Newport and verbally gave his instructions to a secretary who made notes of the meeting. She then produced a standard form containing details of the testator, the intended beneficiaries and the estate – which totalled £983,000. £700,000 of which was the family farm. John Williams was a divorcee with four sons. Prior to his death, his eldest son Richard (who had been a partner in the farming business since 1979) had taken over the practical running of the farm before his father instructed his 2014 Will. The Claimant stated that the secretary handed the information over to a paralegal to draft the testator’s will, a discrepancy happened. It is claimed that the paralegal seemingly mis-interpreted the secretary’s notes. The notes that the secretary took would have resulted in the Claimant inheriting a 62.5% share of the reversion. The paralegal drafted that Claimant would inherit the farm outright, with the other three brothers only receiving 12.5% of the residuary estate, not including the farm. The testator was sent the drafted will, but he didn’t note any of the errors and consequently executed the will at the firm’s offices with the paralegal and secretary acting as witnesses. Following John’s death, the Claimant is challenging the will highlighting the discrepancies, and revealing they didn’t match his father’s final wishes at all. He asked the EWHC to void the will on the grounds of lack of knowledge and intent. The evidence showed that deceased did not appreciate that, under the will, the family farm was not part of the residuary estate and would go entirely to the claimants brother. There was, moreover, no evidence that anything occurred between the giving of the instructions and the finalising of the will to cause the testator to change his mind in any significant way, and he had not contacted the solicitors’ firm to change his instructions during that time.

The Claimants particulars of claim are that the planning laws require the local authority to take into account ‘material considerations’ when deciding whether to grant planning permission. In order to be a material consideration, a matter had to involve a public interest that required protection through the planning process. The defendant is arguing that the fact the extension would reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the panels only affected private interests, and could not therefore be a material consideration. The defendant states that the essential point is that both the local plan and, more recently and much more particularly, the NPPF recognise the positive contribution that can be made to climate change by even small-scale renewable energy schemes’. The defendant is stating that the question of whether the planning decision in this case reduced the effect of activities aimed at mitigating climate change was, therefore, a matter of public interest and a material consideration – and overturned the planning permission.The Claimant seeks the judgment of the court to reverse the planning decision.",Planning
